# SnapQuote — Business & Marketing Summary

**What it is**  
SnapQuote (from Haven Tech Solutions) turns a texted estimate into a professional PDF quote. Contractors text their estimate to a number; within about a minute they get a link to a polished, shareable quote—no app, no forms, no manual formatting.

**Who it’s for**  
Contractors and small businesses who send quotes to customers and want to look professional without extra admin. Anyone who’s already typing estimates in notes or messages and would rather send a PDF link than a wall of text.

**Problem it solves**  
Estimates sent as plain text look informal and are hard for customers to reference. Building a proper quote in Word or a separate tool takes time. SnapQuote bridges that gap: same quick text workflow, but the customer gets a clean PDF and a link they can save or forward.

**How it works (customer-facing)**  
1. Text your estimate to the SnapQuote number (names, items, amounts—any format).  
2. Optionally send a logo photo once; it appears on your quotes.  
3. Get a reply with a link to your PDF.  
4. Share the link with your customer.

**Why it’s different**  
- No app to install; works with the phone they already use.  
- No templates or forms; they write the estimate the way they already do.  
- Fast: estimate in, link back in under a minute.  
- Professional output: PDF with line items, totals, and optional branding.

**Value proposition**  
“Text your estimate. Get a pro quote link.” — Less hassle, more professional image, same speed.

**Use in marketing**  
Lead with the speed and simplicity (text → link). Emphasize “no app” and “no forms.” Mention optional logo for branding. Target contractor/small-business audiences (trade pros, handymen, landscapers, etc.). Haven Tech Solutions is the company behind the product; SnapQuote is the product name.
