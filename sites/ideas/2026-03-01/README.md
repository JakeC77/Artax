Landing page for **ContractMind**, the best-rated idea from Artax's overnight BD research.

## What's here
- `index.html` — Full marketing/landing page for ContractMind

## The idea
ContractMind: AI contract tracker for freelancers and small teams.
Upload a contract, get: instant summary, risk flags, key dates, calendar alerts, plain-English chat.

**$19/mo Pro · $49/mo Team · Free tier (3 contracts)**

## Why it's the best pick
- B2C, self-serve, 60M TAM (US freelancers alone)
- 2-3 week MVP build (PDF + Claude + dashboard)
- Jake's existing tech stack maps perfectly
- No enterprise sales, no procurement
- Natural long-term synergy with DejaView (extracted contract entities = knowledge graph)

## Other ideas researched
1. GraphPulse — automated Geodesic executive briefings ($500-1500/mo/client upsell)
2. QuoteKit — no-code SMS quoting platform based on SnapQuote ($49-99/mo SaaS)
