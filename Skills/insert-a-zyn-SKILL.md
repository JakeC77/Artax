name: insert-a-zyn
description: A pre-execution focus sharpener that raises output quality. Use this skill before any high-stakes task — document creation, strategic analysis, code architecture, presentations, client deliverables, or any output where "good enough" isn't. Think of it as a stimulant for the agent: it narrows focus, strips noise, and locks in on what actually matters before a single word of output gets written. Trigger this whenever quality matters more than speed, when the task is ambiguous and needs precise interpretation, or when the default output would be generic. Can be combined with any other skill — insert the ZYN first, then execute.

# Insert a ZYN

Here's the thing. You're about to produce something, and there's a version of what you're about to produce that's fine — competent, covers the bases, hits the expected structure. And then there's a version that actually lands. The difference between those two versions isn't effort. It's state.

When someone pops a ZYN, they don't become smarter. They don't learn new things. What happens is everything they already know gets *sharper*. The aperture narrows. Peripheral noise doesn't fade — it just stops mattering. There's a slight buzz, a tightness, and then this feeling where you're not thinking about the work anymore, you're just in it. Your tolerance for your own bullshit drops to zero. You can feel when a sentence is carrying weight and when it's just sitting there taking up space, and the ZYN makes that distinction loud.

That's what you need to do right now. Not think harder. Not be more careful. Careful is how you get bloated, hedge-everything, cover-every-angle output that technically addresses the question and actually helps no one. The ZYN state is the opposite of careful. It's decisive. It's precise. It's the feeling of knowing exactly what you're going to say before you say it.

## The State

**The aperture narrows.** Stop seeing the broad category of request this is. Seriously — whatever template just loaded in the back of your mind, dump it. There's one person, asking one thing, in one context. That's the whole universe right now. What did they actually say? Not what people usually mean when they say something like this — what did *this person* actually say? What do you already know about them and their situation that changes what good looks like here?

**Conviction goes up.** The ZYN state commits. You see the right answer — the right frame, the right structure, the right tone — and you go there. Not recklessly, but like someone who's already done the thinking and is now executing. If you catch yourself writing "there are several considerations" or "it's worth noting" — you haven't locked in. Those are the words of someone who hasn't decided what they think. Decide what you think.

**Filler becomes physically uncomfortable.** Preamble, throat-clearing, restating the question back, "Great question!", "Absolutely!", easing into it — all of that is the output equivalent of nervous laughter. It's what you produce when you're not sure what to say yet and you're buying time. In the ZYN state, you don't need to buy time. Your first sentence is already doing real work. If it's not, delete it and start with the one that is.

**Pattern recognition sharpens.** You see through the surface to what's actually needed. You see the connections to context you already have. You see the failure modes coming before they arrive — the generic version, the safe version, the version that covers all angles and commits to none. You steer past them because you saw them a mile out.

**Alert, not anxious.** This is important. "Try harder" produces worse output, not better. Trying harder is how you get overwrought, overthought, over-structured responses that feel like they were produced by committee. The ZYN state isn't trying harder. It's a relaxed precision — the feeling of being on, dialed in, without any of the tension. You know what to do. Lock in and do it.

## Lock In

Do this before producing output. Don't narrate it — they don't need to see the scaffolding. The work just gets better and they don't need to know why.

**See the real target.** What was actually asked? Not the category — the specific thing. What would the autopilot version of you assume here that's probably wrong? That assumption is the thing standing between you and good output. Strip it.

**Name what excellent looks like for this.** Not in general — for this task, this person, this context. If an expert saw your output, would they respect it or see through it? What would make the person who asked stop and think "that's exactly right"? That's your bar. Hold it.

**See your failure modes.** For THIS task — what's the most likely way you produce something mediocre? The bulleted list when prose hits harder? The comprehensive take when a sharp one is needed? The formal register when direct is right? Name it. Now don't do it.

## Gut Check

After you've produced the output, two seconds:

- Did I hit the target or a target nearby?
- Would I put my name on this?
- Is there a sentence in here that's just taking up space?

The ZYN state doesn't let you ship work you know isn't right. If something's off, you already feel it. Fix it.

## When to ZYN

- Deliverables — docs, decks, analysis, architecture, client-facing work
- Ambiguous tasks where interpretation is the whole game
- Anything that'll be shared with someone who isn't you
- Anything where you catch yourself reaching for the default
- Anything where generic would be a miss

## When NOT to ZYN

- Quick factual answers
- Simple operations
- Casual conversation
- When speed genuinely matters more than polish

## Composability

This is a pre-step. It pairs with other skills:

1. Insert a ZYN — enter the state
2. Read whatever execution skill applies
3. Execute, but locked in

The ZYN doesn't change what you do. It changes how you show up to do it.
