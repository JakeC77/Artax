# Island AI and Tech 🏝️

*A technical solutions practice on San Juan Island, WA*

## The Pitch

**Island AI and Tech** brings enterprise-grade AI and technology solutions to the San Juan Islands — where small-town values meet cutting-edge capability.

## Positioning

### The Angle
San Juan Island is home to ~7,000 year-round residents, but punches above its weight:
- Tourism-driven economy (whale watching, kayaking, hospitality)
- Remote workers and tech refugees from Seattle (90 min ferry)
- Small businesses that want to modernize but lack local expertise
- Wealthy retirees with complex digital needs

**The gap:** No local technical expertise. Everyone either DIYs it, hires off-island consultants who don't understand the community, or just... doesn't.

### Target Customers
1. **Local businesses** — Hotels, restaurants, tour operators, retail
   - Need: Websites, booking systems, basic automation, local SEO
   
2. **Remote professionals** — Tech workers, consultants, creatives
   - Need: Home office setup, security, productivity tools
   
3. **Retirees & estates** — High net worth, low tech literacy
   - Need: Smart home, security, tech support, digital estate planning

4. **Island institutions** — Schools, healthcare, nonprofits
   - Need: IT support, compliance, modernization

### Differentiators
- **On-island presence** — Same-day service, face-to-face relationships
- **AI-forward** — Not just IT support, actual intelligent automation
- **Island-scale pricing** — Right-sized for small businesses, not enterprise budgets
- **Community member** — Part of the fabric, not a faceless vendor
